# Rest-API-for-split-data-encryption-and-decryption
API
The project aims to develop a Spring Boot API that provides secure data encryption and decryption services. The API allows clients to encrypt sensitive information using the AES encryption algorithm and also provides functionality to decrypt the encrypted data.

Endpoint 1: [https://split-shild-api.onrender.com/process-string](url)

The /process-string endpoint of the Spring Boot API accepts a string of sensitive data and performs encryption using the AES encryption algorithm. It provides a secure way to protect sensitive information by converting it into an encrypted form.

Endpoint 2: [https://split-shild-api.onrender.com/process-two-strings](url)

The /process-two-strings endpoint of the Spring Boot API is designed to merge and encrypt two strings of sensitive data using the AES encryption algorithm. It provides a secure way to combine and protect multiple pieces of sensitive information into a single encrypted form.
